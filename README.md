gopl learning and implementation

### This repository is to learn Go programming language and mainly based on the [Go语言圣经](https://github.com/gopl-zh/gopl-zh.github.com.)

** Simple Tour of Go **

* Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. 
* Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. 
* Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. 
* It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
